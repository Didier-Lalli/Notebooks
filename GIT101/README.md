# GIT 101 - Understand GIT well enough to join the open source community!

In this workshop we’ll learn how to master enough of Git concepts to become members of the open source community. This workshop is based on real life use cases and we will go through the following:

1. I'd like to share something with the open source community
2. I’d like to use something from the community
3. I'd like to report an issue on a project
4. I'd like to contribute code to a project

You do not need to be a developer to participate, you will not have to write any code. Instead we will use bash scripting to learn Git through its Command Line Interface (CLI).

The notebook uses Bash
