    "# Git\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Wikipedia: \"Git is a distributed **version-control system** (VCS) for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Its current maintainer since 2005 is Junio Hamano. As with most other distributed version-control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. Git is free and open-source software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The origin of the name Git is unclear and subject to many interpretations :-).\n",
    "\n",
    "Latest version is 2.25 from the 13-JAN-2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other competitor products include Subversion, Microsoft Team Foundation Server, Mercurial, CVS, Perforce, Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, Rational ClearCase. According to a survey from StackOverflow, Git was used by 87.2% of developers in 2018 and is still growing.\n",
    "\n",
    "# GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Some commercial companies are providing Source Code Management (SCM) solutions based on Git. One of the most popular one is GitHub (http://github.com). It was bought by Microsoft in 2018. According to Wikipedia, as of January 2020, GitHub reports having over 40 million users and more than 100 million repositories (including at least 28 million public repositories), making it the largest host of source code in the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "Competitors to GitHub include: Bitbucket, Microsoft Team Foundation Server, Gitlab, Phabricator, Assembla, Beanstalk, Helix Core, Gerrit, SourceForge. We can safely claim that Git is a key component of the open source community and has contributed to its rise. \n",

    "# Git Command Line Interface (CLI)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people interact with Git using its command line interface (CLI) in a terminal/command window. But for those of you not confortable with CLI, lots of Git graphical user interfaces (GUIs) exist and most of them are open source. Choosing one is generally a matter of personal preference. The following site might help picking one up.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Git_GUIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you choose to use a Git GUI, it’s best to learn the basics of Git using the CLI. We will be using the CLI in this workshop but don't worry, you will not have a lot of typing to do.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Use case 1: I'd like to share something with the community\n",
    "2. Use case 2: I’d like to use something from the community\n",
    "3. Use case 3: I'd like to report an issue on a project\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use case #1: I'd like to share something with the community\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with this use case, as this will allow us to create a repository to work with during the rest of the workshop. It's also a good community practice to have your own GitHub account and share things with others when appropriate. Sharing and versioning was initially invented for source code, but many other things can be shared on GitHub including PDF files (tutorials for examples), config files, markdown files, and Jupyter Notebooks. So, don't be shy and contribute.\n",

You can add contributors to your project and each will work the same way, using a local repo, then pushing back centrally.

    "There are multiple ways to install git on your machine. For Windows platforms, one option is to install from https://gitforwindows.org/. For Mac, the easiest is to use brew: `brew install git`. Both will install the command line interface (CLI) to Git. If you prefer graphical user interfaces, you have plenty of options, too. A recommended one, for both Windows and Mac, is GitHub Desktop (https://desktop.github.com/. This said, you might not need any of these as there is a very good integration of Git in most code editors. For example, Visual Studio Code, which has now become a very popular open source Integrated Development Environment (IDE), has very good support for Git.\n",
